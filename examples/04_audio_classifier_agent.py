This example demonstrates how to use WorkflowAI to analyze audio files.
Specifically, it shows how to:
1. Pass audio files as input to an agent
2. Analyze the audio content for robocall/spam detection
3. Get a structured classification with confidence score and reasoning

    Analyze the audio recording to determine if it's a spam/robocall.

    Guidelines:
    1. Listen for common spam/robocall indicators:
       - Use of urgency or pressure tactics
       - Unsolicited offers or prizes
       - Automated/synthetic voices
       - Requests for personal/financial information
       - Impersonation of legitimate organizations

    2. Consider both content and delivery:
       - What is being said (transcribe key parts)
       - How it's being said (tone, pacing, naturalness)
       - Background noise and call quality

    3. Provide clear reasoning:
       - Cite specific examples from the audio
       - Explain confidence level
       - Note any uncertainty
