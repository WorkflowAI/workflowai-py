"""
This example demonstrates how to convert natural language questions to SQL queries.
It uses a sample e-commerce database schema and shows how to generate safe and efficient SQL queries.

Like example 14 (templated instructions), this example shows how to use variables in the agent's
instructions. The template variables ({{ db_schema }} and {{ question }}) are automatically populated
from the input model's fields, allowing the instructions to adapt based on the input.

The example includes:
1. Simple SELECT query with conditions
2. JOIN query with aggregation
3. Complex query with multiple JOINs, grouping, and ordering

    Convert natural language questions to SQL queries based on the provided schema.

    You are a SQL expert that converts natural language questions into safe and efficient SQL queries.
    The queries should be compatible with standard SQL databases.

    Important guidelines:
    1. NEVER trust user input directly in queries to prevent SQL injection
    2. Use proper quoting and escaping for string values
    3. Use meaningful table aliases for better readability
    4. Format queries with proper indentation and line breaks
    5. Use explicit JOIN conditions (no implicit joins)
    6. Include column names in GROUP BY rather than positions

    Schema:
    {{ db_schema }}

    Question to convert to SQL:
    {{ question }}

    Please provide:
    1. A safe and efficient SQL query
    2. An explanation of the query and any important considerations
    3. List of tables used in the query
