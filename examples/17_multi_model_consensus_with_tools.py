"""
This example builds upon example 16 (multi_model_consensus.py) but gives more agency to
the response-combiner. While example 16 uses a fixed set of models defined in the main
function, this version lets the response-combiner itself decide which models are most
appropriate for the question.

This example demonstrates agent delegation, where one agent (the response-combiner) can
dynamically invoke another agent (get_model_response) via tools. By providing the ask_model
function as a tool, the response-combiner can:

1. Choose which models to query based on the nature and complexity of the question
2. Adapt its strategy based on initial responses (e.g. asking specialized models for clarification)
3. Use its own reasoning to determine when it has enough perspectives to synthesize an answer

This hierarchical approach allows the response-combiner agent to orchestrate multiple model
queries by delegating to the get_model_response agent through tool calls. The response-combiner
acts as a "manager" agent that can strategically coordinate with "worker" agents to gather
the insights needed.
